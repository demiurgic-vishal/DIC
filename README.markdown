## Digital Image Correlation using Matlab

I made this program for my ME321(Advanced Mechanics of Solids) course. This program calculates all the stresses and strains and plots them with x and y coordinates. I am basically correlating two images, one before the loading, the other one after the loading and using image correlation I am trying to find the displacements and hence strains.
